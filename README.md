- **01_use_pycelonis:** Mainly Pulling and pushing data from Celonis, including pulling data through an Analysis component and writing PQL queries
- **02_try_ml_use_cases:** Machine learning example use cases that can serve as a starting point for building your own custom ML use case on the Celonis platform

## PyCelonis

PyCelonis allows you to connect to Celonis from Python.

Using this package you can programmatically interact with Analyses, Workspaces, Datamodels, Datapools and other Celonis objects.
The package also allows pushing and pulling data to and from data pools and data models.
